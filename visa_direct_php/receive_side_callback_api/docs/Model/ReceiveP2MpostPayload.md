The field data type will be string(16-19) after decryption. | 
**visa_transaction_id** | **string** | Numeric. It contains a right-justified, VisaNet generated Transaction Identifier (TID) that is unique for each request. The identifier links original messages to subsequent messages, such as those for exception item processing and clearing record. |
